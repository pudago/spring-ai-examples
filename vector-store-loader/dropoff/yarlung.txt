The Chinese have a deep obsession with being number one in the world. The Three 
Gorges Project was designed to surpass the Itaipu Dam in both installed capacity 
and annual power generation, a victory that Jiang Zemin could hardly wait to 
announce back in 1997.
But bad news has arrived: the Grand Inga Dam in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo is poised to overtake the Three Gorges Project, claiming the crown for 
worldâ€™s largest dam. To counter this, the Lower Yarlung Tsangpo Hydropower 
Project must be built at an even larger scale, ensuring that China retains its position 
as the global leader in hydropower engineering.
The Three Gorges Project was born out of extreme nationalism, and so too is the 
Lower Yarlung Tsangpo Hydropower Project.
